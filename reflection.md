Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?

Honestly I don't it's that important, but also we haven't done anything big enough to really need it.  Debugging with print statements worked completley fine for A4. But for a big project where writing a bunch of debug prints and then having to go clean all of them up would be annying I can definetly see the use of unit tests.

I just filled out the tests that were already in the file, they do pretty much exacly what the readme says. The only thing is for the last one I couldn't figure out how to use an assert to test printManifest() since it doesn't update any values and doesn't return anything, so I left it to always pass.

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Junit sucks and won't compile. It works from the testing tab but if you use the run button or compile manually it goes " error: package org.junit does not exist" even though it's RIGHT THERE.
